NAnt

What is it? 
-----------
NAnt is a .NET based build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without 
make's wrinkles. In practice it's a lot like Ant. 
  
If you are not familiar with Jakarta Ant you can get more information at the
Ant project web site (http://ant.apache.org/).


Why NAnt?
---------
Because Ant was too Java specific.
Because Ant needed the Java runtime.  NAnt only needs the .NET runtime.
